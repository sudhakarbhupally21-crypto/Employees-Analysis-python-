# üìà HR Performance Quantifier & Talent Pipeline Model

## Project: Data-Driven Promotion and High-Potential Employee Identification (Skillovilla Python Test)

This project addressed the lack of standardized, data-driven performance metrics for promotion decisions by building a quantifiable model to evaluate employee project execution across the organization.

---

### üîç Challenge & Objective

* **Situation:** The company lacked a standardized, data-driven system for performance reviews, resulting in inconsistencies and subjectivity in promotion decisions.
* **Goal:** Build a **quantifiable statistical model** to objectively compare employee performance based on project completion rates versus target timelines, irrespective of seniority level.

### üî¨ Action & Skills Demonstrated

* **Data Engineering (Python/Pandas):** Utilized **Python (Pandas)** to process and merge diverse employee project datasets sourced from multiple **Advanced Excel** workbooks.
* **Data Hygiene:** Handled missing values and standardized time-to-completion metrics into a single, reliable metric: **Project Completion Efficiency (PCE)**.
* **Statistical Modeling:** Applied statistical analysis to normalize PCE scores across different seniority levels and project complexities to ensure fair comparison.
* **Tools:** Developed the analysis within a **Jupiter notebook** environment.

### ‚úÖ Result & Business Impact

* **Talent Identification:** Enabled the identification of the **top 15% of high-potential employees** who consistently demonstrated superior performance.
* **Quantified Improvement:** The model successfully identified employees achieving an average **PCE improvement of 15%** over the baseline, providing empirical data for promotion justification.
* **Strategic Outcome:** Streamlined the talent pipeline for leadership roles, ensuring promotion decisions are grounded in objective, measurable performance data.
